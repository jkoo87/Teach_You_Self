# Teach_You_Self: Three.js

##Why did you choose this subject?

- After learning about frameworks, we wanted to explore something different.

##What problem does it solve?

- Three.js allows 3d animations using the JavaScript language only(no browser plugins needed) .

##What are the alternatives?

- Babylon.js
- Whitestorm.js
- PlayCanvas
- Famous

##What is it similar to, if anything?

- Babylon.js
- The main difference between the two lies in their intended use. While it may be true either of these frameworks can be shoehorned into creating the same 3D animation, itâ€™s important to know what each was created to accomplish.

##What is the history of this technology?

- The origins of the library can be traced back to his involvement with the demoscene in the early 2000s. The code was first developed in ActionScript, then in 2009 ported to JavaScript. In Cabello's mind, the two strong points for the transfer to JavaScript were not having to compile the code before each run and platform independence. With the advent of WebGL, Paul Brunt was able to add the renderer for this quite easily as Three.js was designed with the rendering code as a module rather than in the core itself.[7] Cabello's contributions include API design, CanvasRenderer, SVGRenderer and being responsible for merging the commits by the various contributors into the project.


##Who built it and why?

- Three.js was first released by Ricardo Cabello.

##Who is maintaining it?

- WebGL

##What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?

<<<<<<< HEAD


##What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?

- None of us knew anything about graphical program language that it took a while for us to figure out how to generate and display 3d objects.
